* TODO
  +1 combine TBA a& FBA in one synth+
  +2 the synthdef should be small, stable n ready to, definitely not extensive+
  +3 the oscfunc trigger is going to work outside the synthdef+
  +4 file classification+
  +5 velocity tracking (running max)+

  +/1 synthdef bc we can use the velocity detection from the TBA to the FBA as well, even if the TBA did not detect an onset./+

  +6 the buffers should be loaded from the beginning, and they are going to be changed via an argument in the synthdef, see (buffer help)+
  +7 every sound has multiple versions -playback- with filters, rate, etc+
  +8 user interface from the computer, osc messages via network to Bela to control threshold+
  +9 FIX CHOOSE EVERYTIME DIFFERENT ELEMENT FROM ARRAY+
  +10 overlap sounds if 1 2 3 sounds close to each other the last is everytime going to be gate:0 so it doesnt overload. Additionaly remove any no needed stuff from the code+

  +/make first 2 - 3 sounds with variations and build the sample player, then I will have smth working and do the rest/+
